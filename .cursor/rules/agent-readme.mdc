# Markdown File Handling

- GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) format only

- Prefer linking to a directory path (e.g., `docs/`) rather than its `README.md` (e.g., `docs/README.md`) in Markdown, since GitHub auto-renders the directory by loading `README.md` implicitly.

- Do not directly modify `docs/dsm_demo_cli/README.md` because it is geenrated by `./examples/sync/dsm_demo_cli.py --gen-doc`
