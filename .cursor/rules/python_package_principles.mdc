# Principles and Tools for Python Package Documentation

This guide outlines key principles and tools for creating discoverable, well-documented Python packages that are usable even in offline environments.

## Core Principles

### 1. Self-Documentation

_Principle_: A package should explain itself without requiring external resources.

_Implementation_:

- Use descriptive names for modules, classes, functions, and variables
- Provide comprehensive docstrings at all levels
- Include examples within docstrings showing actual usage
- Make help accessible through standard Python mechanisms

### 2. Accessibility

_Principle_: Documentation should be accessible through multiple standard pathways.

_Implementation_:

- Support standard Python help mechanisms
- Provide command-line help through standard interfaces
- Include offline-accessible examples and tutorials
- Structure the package to follow Python conventions

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

_Principle_: Present information in layers of increasing detail.

_Implementation_:

- Provide high-level overview in module docstrings
- Give more detailed explanations in class docstrings
- Include specific parameter details in function docstrings
- Offer in-depth examples for complex functionality

### 4. Consistency

_Principle_: Follow consistent patterns for documentation.

_Implementation_:

- Choose a single docstring style (Google, NumPy, or reStructuredText) and use it consistently
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout documentation
- Structure all similar components in the same way
- Use consistent formatting and organization

## Recommended Tools and Standards

### Documentation Generation

- **Docstring Formats**: Choose between Google style, NumPy style, or reStructuredText
- **Documentation Generators**:
  - Sphinx for comprehensive documentation
  - pydoc for built-in documentation access
  - MkDocs for lightweight documentation websites

### Code Organization

- **Package Structure**: Follow standard Python package layout conventions
- **Entry Points**: Provide standard entry points like `__main__.py`
- **Import Paths**: Design clear, logical import paths

### Accessibility Tools

- **Built-in Help**: Python's built-in `help()` function
- **Command-line Interface**: Standard argparse-based CLI with help flags
- **Interactive Examples**: Jupyter notebooks or runnable scripts in examples directory

## Validation Approaches

To ensure your package is well-documented, verify that users can:

1. Understand package functionality without internet access
2. Access help through standard Python mechanisms
3. Run examples as documentation without external dependencies
4. Navigate the package structure intuitively

By following these principles and using these tools, package authors can create documentation that respects user autonomy while providing necessary guidance.
