# Cursor Rules for AI in Current Workspace

- Maintain flat directory structures
- Utilize established libraries and frameworks to minimize custom code
- Focus on high-impact, essential code - remove peripheral edge cases
- Execute tests using `scripts/run_tests_parallel.sh`:

  Run all tests:

  ```bash
  scripts/run_tests_parallel.sh
  ```

  Run specific test directory:

  ```bash
  scripts/run_tests_parallel.sh tests/cache_structure
  ```

- Resolve type hints properly instead of using type ignore comments
- Include --no-cli-pager flag in AWS CLI commands
- Implement guard clause pattern for cleaner control flow
- Use full project-relative paths for file operations
- Move or rename files and directories with git mv

## Code Quality

- Use pylint for Python linting (no flake8)
- Configure pylint via CLI flags rather than config files
